    <p>Anime, if you are a really great fan of anime just don't missout watching this anime, according to me this is one of the best anime I have ever watched, it's no less then a fairy-tail.... full of adventures and don't forget about the movies... when they end it just ends up with so much of mystrys and questions which are yet to be revealed until the next movie...</p>
    <p>Well... I don't  wanna give any spoiler's.. till then ~SAYONARA</p>
